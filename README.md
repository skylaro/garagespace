A simple state-based scheduling backend for managing multi-car garages.

Families or other organizations might have N + M cars to manage even though there are only N parking spots in the garage. Therefore, finding the optimal way for all cars to park is essential to everyday functionality. Families might prefer to not have their vehicles exposed to the outside elements, and companies might prefer to not have particular employees walk a long distance to the office on a regular basis. Overall, this app seeks to optimize dynamically-changing parking conditions

Users of the app belong to an organization and must drive at least one car. User vehicles can belong to specific parking spot types such as "disabled", "electric", and other user-defined types.
